## Spectral density
Spectral densities are implemented using the [SpectralDensities.jl](https://github.com/quantum-exeter/SpectralDensities.jl) package.
Please refer to its documentation for details of how to use it. For SpiDy.jl, the key type is `LorentzianSD`, which is here used to characterise the spectral density of the environment.
